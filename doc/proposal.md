# LocalFinds - Proposal

## Vision Statement
For students, residents, and tourists who want to easily discover enjoyable places nearby, LocalFinds is a location discovery web application that provides organized, community-generated information about cafés, parks, scenic spots, and other locations. Unlike general search engines or scattered online listings that require time-consuming searches and may provide incomplete information, our product offers a centralized, easy-to-use platform specifically focused on local place discovery with clear descriptions, real recommendations, and simple navigation.


## Features
LocalFinds will provide several essential features that enhance user experience and accessibility. The platform will allow users to post, browse, and discover locations such as cafés, parks, and important community places through organized navigation and search tools. Each location will include detailed descriptions and reviews so users can understand what the place offers before visiting. The interface will be designed to be simple, intuitive, and user-friendly so that people of all technical skill levels can navigate the website comfortably.

## Technology Stack
- **HTML** – Used to create the structure and content of the website pages, including layouts, text, images, and navigation elements.
- **CSS** – Responsible for styling and visual design, such as colors, spacing, fonts, and responsive layout, so the website looks clean and works on different screen sizes.
- **JavaScript** – Provides interactivity and dynamic functionality.
- **Python** – Serves as the core backend programming language used to handle application logic, process requests, and connect the front end to the database.
- **Flask** (Python Framework) – A lightweight web framework used to build the backend of the application. Flask manages routing, server logic, and communication between the user interface and the database, making development faster and more organized.
- **SQLite** – A lightweight database system used to store location data, descriptions, and other information.
- **Render** (Cloud Hosting) – The project may be deployed using Render, a cloud hosting platform that allows web applications to run online. Hosting on Render would make the website accessible to users from anywhere, rather than only on local machines.


## Expected Outcomes
By completing this project, the team expects to produce a fully functional location discovery website that users can rely on to find local places of interest. The development process will provide valuable hands-on experience with web technologies while also improving teamwork, communication, and project management skills. In addition, the finished platform will offer practical benefits to users by providing clear and helpful information about community locations.
