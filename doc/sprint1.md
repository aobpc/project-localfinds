## LocalFinds

- As a user, I want a view post page so that I can read individual posts in detail.
- As a user, I want a post creation page so that I can add new posts to LocalFinds.
- As a user, I want the posts to be stored in a database so they can be displayed and not deleted.
- As a user, I want to be able to store posts in the database so that they are no deleted.
- As a user, I want to ensure through testing that the post database functions work properly so that I can be assured the posts will be saved.
- As a user, I want to be able to build or test LocalFinds so that I know it is working properly.
- As a team, we want a .gitignore file so that unnecessary files are not contributed to the repository.
- As a team, we want an AUTHORS file so that contributions are credited properly.
- As a team, we want an MIT License so that the project has a clear open-source license.

## Retro

### Good

- Working with SQLite was a joy.
- Flask made routes easy to understand and implement.
- Tests pass and website is functional.

### Bad

- Makefile too a while to understand but is an amazing tool.
- Pytest was difficult to implement as temporary databases had to be generated.
- Routing individual posts was complicated to get working.

### Actionable Commitments

- As a team, we will continue making progress on this website. Focusing on styling and implementing an accounts database where users can create accounts and log into a session.
